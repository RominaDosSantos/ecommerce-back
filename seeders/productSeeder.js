        "Platycerium bifurcatum, is a plant also known as Platicerio or Elkhorn, because of the resemblance of its leaves with the antlers of these mammals. It is a fern that is usually used as a hanging plant, the ideal location for the plant is in a luminous place but with an indirect light, since a direct solar incidence can damage the leaves. The watering should be abundant, it needs that the substrate is constantly humid. The ideal is to make a weekly irrigation, submerging the pot during 15-20 minutes in a bucket with water and letting drain later. However, if we opt for a traditional irrigation we have to water it almost daily and without wetting the leaves.It is a plant that requires fairly stable temperatures, although it adapts well in temperatures ranging from 15-30 ÂºC, so at home it will be perfectly.We should not clean the leaves that have a slight hairy layer. This layer is to avoid excessive evaporation and if we remove it we will damage the plant.",

It is a very resistant plant, which needs very little care. However, they have very attractive and ornamental shapes. Where to place it? It can be placed both outdoors and indoors. It is a real all-rounder. Light/Temperature: Light is one of its main requirements. They appreciate indirect light since a very direct sun can burn their leaves.
